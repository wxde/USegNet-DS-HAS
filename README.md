A customized deep learning algorithm used to segment fetus head volume

in this paper, we propose the first fully-automated solution to segment the whole fetal head in ultrasound volumes. the segmentation task is firstly formulated as an end-to-end volumetric mapping under an encoder-decoder deep architecture. we then combine the segmentor with our proposed hybrid attention scheme (has) to select discriminative features and suppress the non-informative volumetric features in a composite and hierarchical manner. has proves to be effective in helping segmentor combating boundary ambiguity and deficiency. to enhance the spatial consistency in the segmentation, we further organize multiple segmentors in a cascaded fashion to refine the result by revisiting the context encoded in the predictions from predecessors. validated on a large dataset, our method
